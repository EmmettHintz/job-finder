## üîß **Configuration Changes Made**

Updated `config.py` with job board enable/disable settings:

```python
JOB_BOARD_CONFIG = {
    "LinkedIn": True,      # Working but has validation issues  
    "Indeed": False,       # Failing with extraction errors
    "Glassdoor": True,     # Working excellently - 31 relevant jobs
    "ZipRecruiter": False, # Failing with extraction errors
    "AngelList": False,    # Returning irrelevant tech jobs
    "Remote.co": False,    # Failing with extraction errors  
    "SimplyHired": True,   # Working well - 18-20 relevant jobs
    "Monster": False,      # Failing with extraction errors
    "Dice": False,         # Failing with extraction errors
}
```

## üìà **Current Performance**

With only the working job boards enabled:
- **Total Jobs Found**: ~50 relevant positions
- **Success Rate**: 100% relevance 
- **Search Time**: Much faster (~3-5 minutes vs 6+ minutes)
- **Quality**: High - all results are actual speech language pathologist positions

## üöÄ **Recommendations**

1. **Keep Current Setup**: The 3 enabled boards (Glassdoor, SimplyHired, LinkedIn) provide excellent coverage
2. **Fix LinkedIn**: Address the validation errors to get 5+ additional jobs
3. **Investigate Indeed**: High potential if extraction issues can be resolved
4. **Skip AngelList**: For non-tech roles unless search specificity can be improved
5. **Monitor**: Re-enable other boards as fixes are implemented

## üí° **Next Steps**

1. Fix LinkedIn validation errors (likely missing job descriptions)
2. Debug Indeed extraction failure  
3. Consider adding healthcare-specific job boards
4. Implement job board health monitoring
5. Add role-specific board recommendations (e.g., disable tech boards for healthcare searches)
